// Reference-motion tracking: DeepMimic-style rewards over a motion file.
//
// The shape of the task is "reproduce these joint angles at these times, on a
// robot that still has to keep its balance". That splits cleanly into two
// halves, and both are needed:
//
//   * TRACKING terms compare the joints against the reference. On their own
//     they are farmable — lying on its side, the duck has no gravity load and
//     can hit any pose asked of it — which is why they never ship alone.
//   * ROOT terms pay for the trunk being where the motion implies. The height
//     target is not a constant: a squat is SUPPOSED to lower the trunk, so a
//     fixed STAND_Z would punish the motion for being performed correctly.
//     The reference height comes from posing the model at each phase and
//     measuring, so it tracks whatever the author wrote.
//
// The policy is NOT given the reference pose. It gets the phase (two slots of
// the command block, as sin/cos so the loop seam is continuous) and has to
// carry the motion itself — the same arrangement DeepMimic uses, and the one
// that leaves a deployed policy self-contained rather than needing the motion
// file shipped alongside it.
