// The four seams between the browser-native trainer and a sim2real-faithful
// one. Each is an interface today with a trivial implementation, so filling it
// in later is additive rather than a rewrite. See docs/training-plan.md §3.
//
// Two contracts here are load-bearing, and both come from expensive failures
// recorded in microduck_rl/AGENTS.md:
//
//   * Randomizers RESTORE then apply. An accumulating CoM randomizer silently
//     degraded every long run for months upstream. Non-accumulation is the
//     interface's promise, not each implementation's good intentions.
//   * Nothing here may index joints by position. Backlash and roller models
//     interleave `passive_*` joints into qpos, so indices are resolved by name
//     once, in JointIndex, and passed around.
