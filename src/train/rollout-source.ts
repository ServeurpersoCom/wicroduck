// Where a rollout comes from.
//
// The learner does not care whether the environments live in this thread or
// across a worker pool — it needs a filled RolloutBuffer and the statistics
// that go with it. Two implementations:
//
//   LocalRollout  one VecEnv here. What the headless checks use, and the
//                 reference behaviour everything else is compared against.
//   PoolRollout   N workers, each with its own slice of environments.
//
// Inference runs wherever the environments are, never across the boundary:
// the policy has to act once per control step per environment, and a message
// round trip in that loop would dominate everything else.
